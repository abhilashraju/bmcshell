If there is no good answer in the article, say I don't know.Article:###BmcShell is an intelligent interactive client for managing IBM Servers. Under the hood, the shell uses redfish schema-based rest interfaces to interact with the server. schema-based you can query the shell about available commands to interact with servers. You don't have to remember the redfish APIs in order to interact with BMC.  By default, the shell is not connected to any IBM machines. You should be connecting to the specific machine before issuing any management commands. You can list available machines' names by issuing machine commands. machines command is not a management command. Ideally, you will be starting with the machine's command. once the list of available machines is displayed in the console. you can issue a selection command to select one among them. The selection command is a generic command used to select one among current active options. syntax if the selection command is s  followed by space then arguments for the selection every command will have syntax as follows command <space> arguments separated by <space> in the case of the selection command, the first argument will be the option number of the selection. the argument may be followed by one or more arguments corresponding to the currently selected options   Session Management To manage the BMC, HMC needs to authenticate itself over a secure channel BMC supports Redfish for the standard Redfish schema and it also supports REST interface for the IBM specific use cases. HMC should use the REST as well as the Redfish interface with BMC based on the required functionality. HMC should create the redfish session which returns the authentication token from the BMC. This token can be used for the subsequent Redfish and REST queries. Rest interface will be used for following scenarios 1) Save Area Management 2) Lock Management 3) VMI IP Discovery 4) VMI Certificate Exchange 5) Dump Offload (if the interface doesn’t get standardized) Redfish interface will be used for following scenarios 1) Firmware update 2) Error Log 3) System Power On/Off 4) BMC Capabilities 5) Other Management operations 3.1 Creating Redfish Session When HMC connects to BMC for the first time, HMC should use the ‘admin’ user and admin privileges to create the initial session. With the valid user name and password, the session will be created, and the response header will contain the ‘X-Auth-Token’ which should be saved and used by the client for any further interaction with the server through this session.   You don't have to worry about session expiry when you use Bmcshell to interact with servers. Bmcshell will automatically reclaim the session on expiry. However, you must enter your username and password to Bmcshell at least once. You can use the following command for setting your username and password. username  Bmc user name  password  Bmc password ### ",
